# Aviation Accident Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes data of aviation accidents to recommend the best aircrafts for your business to invest in.

## Business Problem
Your company has decided to expand the industries to diversify its portfolio and has chosen aviation to invest in. They are interested in finding aircrafts for private and commercial enterprises. However, they do not know the potential risks that come with each aircraft make, so it's your job to determine the potential risks that may arise on investment. Finally, analyze them to yield three actionable recommendations for the head of their Aviation team to make.

## Data Understanding
The data includes information from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters. This information will be useful for finding the best aircraft models to invest in based on previous accidents.

The original Avaiation dataframe includes 18 columns and around 9600 entries. For each incident it covers 18 categories, including but not limited to the investigation type, make and model of the plane, location data, and damage to the plane and injuries to passengers. In the US State Codes dataframe there are two columns, one with the state names and their corresponding code in the neighboring cell. This information will be analyzed to create visualizations which will subsequently aid in the final recommendations.

## Data Analysis
This analysis centers on aviation accidents within the United States and international waters, and is conducted with the aim of providing valuable insights to your company’s stakeholders. The ultimate objective is to provide recommendations about which aircraft models would be most profitable, with the least potential risk on investing.

## Methods
This project uses descriptive analysis, comparative analysis, and visualizations to draw conclusions from the aviation accidents data.

# Results 

## Conclusions

This analysis yields three actionable recommendations for your business to review:
1. Invest in Boeing airplanes
   - Lowest ratio of accidents to events
   - A lower chance of both injury and fatality when flying. 
2. Any Boeing model except for model 737. 
   - If we invest, we need to consider the following:
      - Boeing is the only outlier with more mechanical error than human error.
      - There needs to be an investment on a high quality maintenance team.
3. Commercial aircraft over private
   - Most accidents occur on smaller private aircrafts (one-engine/reciprocating engine).
   - i.e. Cessna (High human errors with insufficient safety measures)
